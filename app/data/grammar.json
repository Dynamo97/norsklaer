    "fullContent": "## Understanding Gender in Norwegian\n\nIn Norwegian, every noun belongs to one of three families. Think of gender as a **grammatical category** that forces surrounding words—like articles and adjectives—to change their shape.\n\n### 1. The Three Families\nYou identify the gender by the **indefinite article** (the word for 'a/an'):\n\n| Gender | Article | Example | Translation |\n| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |\n| **Masculine** | `en` | *en stol* | a chair |\n| **Feminine** | `ei` | *ei bok* | a book |\n| **Neuter** | `et` | *et hus* | a house |\n\n> **Pro Tip:** In many urban dialects, you can treat Feminine nouns as Masculine (e.g., *en bok*). However, learning the feminine form helps you understand more dialects and literature!\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Definite Form (The 'The')\nUnlike English, where we put 'the' in front, Norwegian attaches the article to the **end** of the word:\n\n* **Masculine:** *en stol* → *stolen* (the chair)\n* **Feminine:** *ei bok* → *boka* (the book)\n* **Neuter:** *et hus* → *huset* (the house)\n\n### 3. Adjective Agreement\nAdjectives change to match the gender. Usually, neuter nouns force the adjective to add a **-t**:\n\n* **Masculine:** En **stor** mann (A big man)\n* **Feminine:** Ei **stor** sol (A big sun)\n* **Neuter:** Et **stort** eple (A big apple)\n\n---\n\n### 4. How to Learn Genders\nThere are very few logical rules (e.g., *et bord* is neuter, but *en stol* is masculine). \n\n**The Golden Rule:** Never learn a noun alone. Always save the word with its article in your flashcards (e.g., save **'en stol'**, not just **'stol'**)."

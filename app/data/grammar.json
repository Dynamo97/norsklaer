        "fullContent": "## Understanding Gender in Norwegian\n\nIn Norwegian, every noun belongs to one of three families. Think of gender as a **grammatical category** that forces surrounding words—like articles and adjectives—to change their shape.\n\n### 1. The Three Articles\nYou identify the gender by the **indefinite article** (the word for 'a/an'):\n\n* **Masculine:** Uses **en** (Example: *en stol* - a chair)\n* **Feminine:** Uses **ei** (Example: *ei bok* - a book)\n* **Neuter:** Uses **et** (Example: *et hus* - a house)\n\n> **Pro Tip:** In many urban dialects, you can treat Feminine nouns as Masculine (e.g., *en bok*). However, learning the feminine form helps you understand more dialects and regional accents!\n\n---\n\n### 2. The Definite Form (The 'The')\nUnlike English, where we put 'the' in front, Norwegian attaches the article to the **end** of the word as a suffix:\n\n* **Masculine:** *en stol* → **stolen** (the chair)\n* **Feminine:** *ei bok* → **boka** (the book)\n* **Neuter:** *et hus* → **huset** (the house)\n\n\n\n### 3. Adjective Agreement\nAdjectives change to match the gender. Usually, neuter nouns force the adjective to add a **-t**:\n\n* **Masculine:** En **stor** mann (A big man)\n* **Feminine:** Ei **stor** sol (A big sun)\n* **Neuter:** Et **stort** eple (A big apple)\n\n---\n\n### 4. How to Learn Genders\nThere are very few logical rules for why a word has a specific gender (e.g., *et bord* is neuter, but *en stol* is masculine). \n\n**The Golden Rule:** Never learn a noun alone. Always save the word with its article in your flashcards. \n\n* **Wrong way:** Save 'stol' as 'chair'\n* **Right way:** Save **'en stol'** as 'a chair'\n\n### 5. Common Patterns\nWhile you must memorize most, look out for these clues:\n* Words ending in **-ing** are usually Masculine (*en trening*).\n* Words ending in **-het** are usually Masculine (*en frihet*).\n* Many nature words and body parts are Feminine (*ei sol, ei dør*)."

        "fullContent": "## The V2 Rule: The Golden Rule of Norwegian\n\nIn English, we can be flexible with where we put our verbs. In Norwegian, we are not. The **V2 Rule** states that in a standard declarative sentence, the **Verb must be the second element.**\n\n### 1. Basic Sentence Structure\nIn a simple sentence, the structure is just like English: **Subject + Verb + Object**.\n\n* **Example:** *Jeg snakker norsk.* (I speak Norwegian.)\n* **Breakdown:** 1. Jeg (Subject) | 2. **snakker** (Verb) | 3. norsk (Object).\n\n### 2. The 'Shift' (Inversion)\nThis is where it gets tricky! If you start a sentence with anything *other* than the subject—like a time or a place—the verb **must stay in position #2**. This forces the subject to move to position #3.\n\n \n\n**Start with Time:**\n* **Correct:** *Nå* **snakker** *jeg* norsk. (Now speak I Norwegian.)\n* **Incorrect:** *Nå jeg snakker norsk.*\n\n**Start with Place:**\n* **Correct:** *I Norge* **snakker** *jeg* norsk. (In Norway speak I Norwegian.)\n* **Incorrect:** *I Norge jeg snakker norsk.*\n\n### 3. What counts as 'One Element'?\n'Position #2' doesn't necessarily mean the second *word*. It means the second **grammatical unit**. Entire phrases can occupy Position #1.\n\n* **Example:** *Min snille bestemor* (1) **er** (2) *fra Bergen* (3).\n* **Explanation:** 'My nice grandmother' is three words, but it is **one** element (the subject).\n\n--- \n\n### 4. Summary Checklist\n\n* **The Verb is always #2** in statements.\n* **If something moves to the front**, the Subject must jump behind the Verb.\n* **Questions** are the main exception: the Verb usually moves to Position #1 (e.g., *Snakker du norsk?*).\n\n**The Golden Rule:** If you are in doubt, find your verb and make sure it is the second thing you say!"

        "shortDescription": "Learn how to turn 'one' into 'many' using the standard -er and -ene endings.",
        "fullContent": "## Plurals in Norwegian\n\nTurning a noun into a plural in Norwegian is mostly a matter of adding suffixes. The rules change slightly depending on whether you are talking about 'some' things (Indefinite) or 'those specific' things (Definite).\n\n### 1. Regular Nouns (Masculine & Feminine)\nMost nouns follow a simple pattern: add **-er** for 'some' and **-ene** for 'the'.\n\n* **En stol** (A chair) → **Stoler** (Some chairs) → **Stolene** (The chairs)\n* **Ei avis** (A newspaper) → **Aviser** (Some newspapers) → **Avisene** (The newspapers)\n\n### 2. Neuter Nouns (One Syllable)\nThis is a very important rule! If a **neuter** noun has only **one syllable**, it gets **no ending** when you are talking about 'some' of them.\n\n\n\n* **Et hus** (A house) → **Hus** (Some houses) → **Husene** (The houses)\n* **Et barn** (A child) → **Barn** (Some children) → **Barnene** (The children)\n* **Et eple** (An apple) → **Epler** (Some apples) → **Eplene** (The apples) \n*(Note: 'Eple' has two syllables, so it follows the regular rule!)*\n\n### 3. Quick Summary of Endings\n\n**Masculine & Feminine:**\n* Indefinite plural: Add **-er**\n* Definite plural: Add **-ene**\n\n**Neuter (1 Syllable):**\n* Indefinite plural: **No change**\n* Definite plural: Add **-ene**\n\n**Neuter (2+ Syllables):**\n* Indefinite plural: Add **-er**\n* Definite plural: Add **-ene**\n\n--- \n\n### 4. Important Irregularities\nSome common words change their vowel sound entirely. These are high-frequency words you should memorize early:\n\n* **Bok** (Book) → **Bøker**\n* **Mann** (Man) → **Menn**\n* **Natt** (Night) → **Netter**\n* **Tann** (Tooth) → **Tenner**\n* **Hånd** (Hand) → **Hender**\n\n### 5. Occupations and -er endings\nNouns that already end in **-er** (like professions) have a slightly shorter definite form:\n* **En lærer** (A teacher) → **Lærere** (Teachers) → **Lærerne** (The teachers)\n\n**The Golden Rule:** Always check the gender and syllable count of a neuter noun before pluralizing it!"
